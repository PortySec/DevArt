# Squid Configuration File

# Define the HTTP port Squid will listen on
http_port 3128

# Allow all incoming requests
http_access allow all

# Disable caching
cache deny all

# To use this configuration, save it to a file, for example, "squid.conf".

# You can typically find the Squid configuration directory on Unix/Linux systems at "/etc/squid/".
# So, place the "squid.conf" file in "/etc/squid/".

# To start Squid with this configuration, open your terminal and run:
# sudo systemctl start squid

# Make sure you have appropriate permissions and Squid is installed on your system.
